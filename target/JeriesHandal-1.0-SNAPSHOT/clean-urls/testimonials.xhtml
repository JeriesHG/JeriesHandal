                                        <p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is
                                            to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
                                            If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

                                        <p>I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. 
                                            They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.
